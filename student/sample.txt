The text "int:stud_id" appears to be a placeholder or a variable name that represents an integer value for a student ID in a programming context. It is commonly used in web development or other programming languages that utilize a templating or placeholder syntax for dynamically inserting values into code or generating dynamic content. The "int:stud_id" could be replaced with an actual integer value representing a student ID, such as "<12345>" where "12345" is the specific student ID being referenced in the code or application.
